# musixmatch database:

I'm scraping songs lyrics from musixmatch, and i want to store them in a database(postgresql maybe). My future plans, use this data base and make a full stack app.

**P.S: [docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required**

## installation:

1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cs-fedy/musixmatch-database`
2. run `docker compose up -d` to start the db.
3. change your current directory to scraper dir: `cd scraper`
4. install virtualenv using pip: `sudo pip install virtualenv`
5. create a new virtualenv:  `virtualenv venv`
6. activate the virtualenv: `source venv/bin/activate`
7. install requirements: `pip install requirements.txt`
8. run the script and enjoy: `python scraper.py`

## used tools:

1. [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/): Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.
2. [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/): Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
3. [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/): Add .env support to your django/flask apps in development and deployments.
4. [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/): psycopg2 - Python-PostgreSQL Database Adapter.
