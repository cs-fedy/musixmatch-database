# musixmatch database:

I'm scraping songs lyrics from musixmatch, and i want to store them in a database(postgresql maybe). My future plans, use this data base and make a full stack app.

## installation:

1. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cs-fedy/musixmatch-database`
2. install virtualenv usin pip: `sudo pip install virtualenv`
3. create a new virtualenv:  `virtualenv venv`
4. activate the virtualenv: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. install requirements: `pip install requirements.txt`
6. run the script and enjoy: `python scraper.py`

## used tools:

1. [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/): Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.
2. [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/): Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
